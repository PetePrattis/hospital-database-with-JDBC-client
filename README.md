# A JDBC client Program / Project

**This is a jdbc client project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the fourth semester class Data Bases 
and is the final project for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A jdbc application that runs queries in pgAdmin to simulate the functionality of a hospital's database.

> #### Functionality of project
>
> 1. The database saves information about the hospital's doctors of a variety of departments
> 2. The database saves doctors' information are (name, surname, specialty, contact information, department code, etc.)
> 3. The database saves the hospital's patients and their information (name, surname, contact information, etc.)
> 4. The database saves the appointments and the diagnosis for each patient and information and date about them
> 5. The database saves each patient's medical record, including treatments and prescription drugs
> 6. There is a predetermined dataset used for this project

> #### Impementation of project
>
> 1. Design the relational scheme of the database and implement the creation queries in the PostgreSQL DMBS
> 2. Apply the normalization theory to the relational scheme of the DB to check if it follows 3NF or BCNF
> 3. Insert the data from the given dataset using proper queries
> 4. Implement some functionality using proper queries:
>> a. What are the drugs (maximum and minimum number) prescribed<br/>
>> b. What are the diagnoses of the last week<br/>
>> c. What are the doctor's 'X' appointments last month<br/>
>> d. Who are the patients who have seen more than one doctor<br/>
>> e. From what department have most patients been examined<br/>
>> f. What is the average number of patients examined per department<br/>
> 5. Implement some functionality using triggers:
>> a. Creation of trigger and function that will execute for every patent examined and diagnosis to update patient's medical file<br/>
>> b. Creation of trigger and function that implement's the query d)<br/>
> 6. Connect databse with JDBC client in Java using the proper library
> 7. Write a Java console application that will execute the queries




> #### About this project
>
> - There is a predetermined dataset used for this project
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the archives
> - This project was written in Eclipse Java IDE
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
